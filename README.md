A UMass gaming buddies website. This is a website where you can post what games you want to play and search for people from umass that can join your group. This can be board games, console games etc. We will also have a section where people can give out their CD's/board games for rent or have other people borrow them.
Data types:

Important components: When a user visits the site, they will be asked to create a user account. Each game will have a section which details the description and shows trailers of the games. Under each game there will be a section where users can list the respective game to rent out along with its price. 

In another section, users can make posts about games or that they are looking for people who want to play. These posts can be upvoted or downvoted, and can also be commented on. Here users can create groups to socialize and play that game.
